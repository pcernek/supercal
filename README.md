## Features
- Calculates total time for all events in current view
- Breaks down time by event color
- Draggable and collapsible interface
- Remembers position and state between refreshes
- Google Calendar API integration (optional)

## Development

### Environment Setup

1. **Configure OAuth Client IDs**
   - For development: Create an OAuth client ID for your local extension ID
   - For production: Create an OAuth client ID for your Chrome Web Store extension ID
   - Update the respective config files (`config/config.dev.json` and `config/config.prod.json`)

2. **Build Scripts**
   ```bash
   # Development build
   ./build/build.sh
   
   # Development build with watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
   ./build/build.sh -w
   
   # Production build for Chrome Web Store submission
   ./build/build.sh -e prod
   ```
   
   The watch mode uses a simple file hashing approach to detect changes and doesn't require any external tools.

3. **Testing locally**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist/unpacked` directory
   - After making changes and rebuilding, click the refresh icon on the extension card

See `build/README.md` for more detailed build instructions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files

## Google Calendar API Setup (Optional)

For more reliable data access, you can set up Google Calendar API integration:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a new project
2. Enable the Google Calendar API for your project:
   - In the sidebar, click on "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Calendar API"
   - Click on the API and then click "Enable"
3. Create OAuth credentials:
   - In the sidebar, click on "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Chrome Extension" as the application type
   - Enter a name for your OAuth client (e.g., "Supercal Extension")
   - For "Application ID", enter your extension ID (found in chrome://extensions)
4. Copy your Client ID and update the appropriate config file:
   - For development: Update `config/config.dev.json`
   - For production: Update `config/config.prod.json`
5. Run the appropriate build script and reload the extension

## Usage

1. Navigate to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) in Chrome
2. The extension will automatically display a floating panel with time totals
3. If you've set up the Google Calendar API:
   - Click the Supercal icon in your browser toolbar
   - Click "Sign In" to authenticate with Google
   - Select a date range and click "Fetch Calendar Data"

## How It Works

The extension works in two modes:

1. **DOM Scraping Mode (Default)**: Analyzes the calendar events displayed on the page
2. **API Mode**: Fetches data directly from the Google Calendar API when authorized

The API mode provides more accurate data and works even with collapsed calendar sections.

## Privacy

Supercal only accesses your Google Calendar data with your permission. Your data is processed locally in your browser and is not sent to any external servers.
